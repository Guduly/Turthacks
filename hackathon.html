                <article>
                        <p>Light pollution is the pollution caused by 
                            manmade luminouse acitivty, these activities disrupt local 
                            organisms lifecyle and increase CO2 emmisions in the sky. Light pollution and climate
                            are an immediate consequence of human development, as there is a clear correlation between them. As shown by this graph:

                <h3>Blinds Light Sensor</h3>
                <p>The BLS (Blinds Light sensor) detects light inside indoor environments and utilizes the photoelectric effect to
                    send electrical output to the smart Blinds; which through the power of IOT could be able to close the blinds by itself. 
                    The BLS could be automated to start at a certain time, this would allow for less human interaction and increase consistancy in light levels. 
                    This consistenty in light levels, could decrease light pollution, which in turn decreases CO2 emmisions and disruption of ecosystems.
